            <h4> Here’s a simple and healthy recipe for homemade dog treats that are perfect for your furry companion. These treats are low in calories and packed with nutrients!</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                •	1 medium sweet potato <br>
                •	1/2 cup finely grated carrots <br>
                •	1/2 cup pureed pumpkin (not the spiced pie filling) <br>
                •	1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce (make sure it has no added sugars) <br>
                •	1 cup whole wheat flour (or oat flour for a gluten-free option) <br>
                •	1/2 cup rolled oats <br>
                •	1/4 cup unsalted peanut butter (make sure it doesn’t contain xylitol) <br>
                •	1 egg
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
               	1.	Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). <br>
	2.	Cook the Sweet Potato: <br>
	•	Wash and pierce the sweet potato with a fork. <br>
	•	Microwave it for about 5-8 minutes or until soft. Alternatively, bake it in the oven until tender. <br>
	•	Let it cool, then scoop out the flesh into a bowl and mash it. <br>
	3.	Prepare the Carrots and Pumpkin: If you’re using fresh carrots, finely grate them. If using canned pumpkin, ensure it’s pure pumpkin and not spiced filling. <br>
	4.	Mix Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the mashed sweet potato, grated carrots, pumpkin puree, applesauce, peanut butter, and egg. Mix until well combined. <br>
	5.	Add Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the whole wheat flour and oats to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms. <br>
	6.	Roll Out the Dough: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick. <br>
	7.	Cut Shapes: Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes or cut into squares with a knife. <br>
	8.	Bake: Place the treats on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and firm. <br>
	9.	Cool and Store: Let the treats cool completely before giving them to Mac A. Roni. Store them in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze for longer storage. <br>
